         <p>A formal education is not necessarily the only way to gain a successful career
            in the world of IT.  A college degree will definitely help but fundamental 
            knowledge can be gained through alterantive sources such as: code camps or 
            coding bootcamps, online training programs like "Udemy", free online tutorials 
            and paid tutorials, just to name a few.

         <p>In order to truly thrive in anything one must possess the ability to 
            continuously persevere. This path is not a stright line nor is it 
            a cake walk, this rode has many peaks and valleys fraught with a 
            plethora of obstacles.  In order to overcome one must bare in mind 
            what they are doing this for, why this is so important to accomplish and 
            if failure is an acceptable outcome.

         <p>On this journey I have felt devoid of confidence in the skils that I have amassed 
            and at times I have even dealt with "Imposter Syndrome"! After admitiing to myself 
            that this brand of thinking was counter productive to my goals as well as counter 
            intuitive in general I decided to make changes in my approach.  Now I am gaining 
            both the skills that I lacked (i.e. hands on experience) as well as the confidence 
            that I never seemed to have regarding my career field.
